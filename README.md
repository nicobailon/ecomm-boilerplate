## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
-   Redis (local instance or a cloud service like Upstash)
-   Stripe Account & CLI

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-ecommerce.git
    cd mern-ecommerce
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Copy the `.env.example` to a new `.env` file in the root directory.
    -   Fill in the required values:
        -   `MONGO_URI`
        -   `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL`
        -   `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` & `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
        -   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
        -   `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` & `UPLOADTHING_SECRET`

4.  **Run the application in development mode:**
    ```bash
    # This command runs both the backend and frontend concurrently
    npm run dev:all
    ```
    -   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
    -   Backend API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Stripe Webhook for Local Development

To test Stripe payments and webhooks locally, you need to forward webhook events to your local server.

1.  **Run the Stripe CLI:**
    ```bash
    stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/payments/webhook
    ```
2.  **Update your `.env` file:**
    -   The CLI will output a webhook signing secret (e.g., `whsec_...`).
    -   Copy this value and add it to your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## üëë Admin System

The application features a role-based system with `customer` and `admin` roles. Admins have exclusive access to the dashboard for managing the store.

### Creating an Admin User

1.  **Sign up** for a new account through the application's UI. By default, this creates a `customer` account.
2.  **Promote the user to admin** by running the provided script from the project root:
    ```bash
    # Replace with the user's email you want to promote
    npm run make-admin admin@example.com
    ```
3.  You can list all users and their roles with `npm run list-users`.

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard

-   Admins log in using the same page as regular customers.
-   Once logged in, an "Admin" or "Dashboard" link will appear in the navigation, leading to the protected admin area.

## üìú Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev:all`: Starts both backend and frontend servers concurrently.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the backend and frontend for production.
