## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   MongoDB (local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
-   Redis (local instance or a cloud service like Upstash)
-   Stripe Account & CLI

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-ecommerce.git
    cd mern-ecommerce
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Copy the `.env.example` to a new `.env` file in the root directory.
    -   Fill in the required values:
        -   `MONGO_URI`
        -   `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL`
        -   `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` & `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
        -   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
        -   `UPLOADTHING_APP_ID` & `UPLOADTHING_SECRET`
        -   `RESEND_API_KEY` & `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` (for email functionality)

4.  **Run the application in development mode:**
    ```bash
    # This command runs both the backend and frontend concurrently
    npm run dev:all
    ```
    -   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
    -   Backend API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Stripe Webhook for Local Development

To test Stripe payments and webhooks locally, you need to forward webhook events to your local server.

1.  **Run the Stripe CLI:**
    ```bash
    stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/payments/webhook
    ```
2.  **Update your `.env` file:**
    -   The CLI will output a webhook signing secret (e.g., `whsec_...`).
    -   Copy this value and add it to your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## üëë Admin System

The application features a role-based system with `customer` and `admin` roles. Admins have exclusive access to the dashboard for managing the store.

### Creating an Admin User

1.  **Sign up** for a new account through the application's UI. By default, this creates a `customer` account.
2.  **Promote the user to admin** by running the provided script from the project root:
    ```bash
    # Replace with the user's email you want to promote
    npm run make-admin admin@example.com
    ```
3.  You can list all users and their roles with `npm run list-users`.

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard

-   Admins log in using the same page as regular customers.
-   Once logged in, an "Admin" or "Dashboard" link will appear in the navigation, leading to the protected admin area.

## üìß Email System

The application includes a robust email system for transactional emails with the following features:

### Email Types

1. **Welcome Emails**: Sent automatically when users sign up
2. **Order Confirmations**: Sent after successful payment processing
3. **Password Reset**: Sent when users request password recovery
4. **Stock Notifications**: Sent when out-of-stock items become available

### Architecture

-   **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses Bull queue with Redis for non-blocking email delivery
-   **Template Engine**: EJS templates with base layout for consistent branding
-   **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatically falls back to synchronous sending if queue is unavailable
-   **Rate Limiting**: Prevents email abuse with configurable limits (5 emails per 15 minutes)

### Email Templates

  Email templates are located at: `/backend/templates/emails/`.

  The templates include:
  - welcome.ejs - New user registration
  - order-confirmation.ejs - Purchase confirmation
  - password-reset.ejs - Password recovery
  - stock-notification.ejs - Back in stock alerts
  - layouts/base.ejs - Base layout wrapper

### Configuration

1. **Required Environment Variables**:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
   EMAIL_ENABLED=true
   ```

2. **Email Features**:
   - HTML and plain text versions of all emails
   - Template caching for improved performance
   - XSS protection in templates
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Comprehensive error logging

### Security

-   **Opt-in Design**: Emails only sent when both API key exists AND `EMAIL_ENABLED=true`
-   **URL Sanitization**: Prevents javascript: and data: URLs in emails
-   **Rate Limiting**: Applied to all email-sending endpoints
-   **Unsubscribe Support**: CAN-SPAM compliant with token-based unsubscribe links

For detailed documentation, see `/backend/docs/email-system.md`.
