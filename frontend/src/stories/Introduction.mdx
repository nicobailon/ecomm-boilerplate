# Design System

Welcome to our component library and design system documentation. This Storybook serves as a living style guide for our e-commerce application's UI components.

## Purpose

This design system helps us:
- Maintain consistency across the application
- Speed up development with reusable components
- Ensure accessibility standards are met
- Document component usage and best practices

## Getting Started

### For Developers

1. Browse components in the sidebar
2. View different states and variants
3. Copy code examples from the "Docs" tab
4. Test components with different themes and viewports

### For Designers

1. Review component variations and states
2. Check theme consistency
3. Validate accessibility with the A11y addon
4. Test responsive behavior

## Core Principles

### 1. Accessibility First
All components are built with accessibility in mind:
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance

### 2. Theme Support
Components support multiple themes:
- Light theme (default)
- Dark theme
- Custom theme variations

### 3. Responsive Design
All components are responsive by default:
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions

### 4. Performance
Components are optimized for performance:
- Minimal bundle size
- Efficient rendering
- Lazy loading where appropriate

## Component Categories

### UI Primitives
Basic building blocks like Button, Input, Badge

### Layout Components
Components for structuring pages and content

### Product Components
E-commerce specific components like ProductCard, CartItem

### Form Components
Input controls and form management components

## Contributing

When adding new components:
1. Create comprehensive stories showing all states
2. Include accessibility testing
3. Add responsive examples
4. Document props and usage
5. Test with all themes
